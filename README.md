# Search Engine and Information Retrieval Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a functional search engine that can effectively retrieve and index information from various datasets. It explores concepts related to information retrieval, ranking algorithms, and user experience optimization.

## Features
- **Web Crawling**: Automatically retrieves web pages and extracts relevant information.
- **Indexing**: Structures the crawled data for faster retrieval using inverted indexing.
- **Search Algorithms**: Implements various algorithms, including TF-IDF and BM25, to rank search results.
- **User Interface**: A simple UI that allows users to enter queries and retrieve results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup for web scraping, Flask for the web framework, and SQLite for database management.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn to implement ranking algorithms.
